    <h1> Robosoft 2022 workshop: <i> Soft Robotics modeling: what are we missing? </i> </h1>
    <p> 
      To model, or not to model? That is a question in soft robotics. 
      Is modeling the way towards next- generation soft robot design, 
      control and best use of embodied intelligence? To what extent 
      can we model the interaction of a soft robot body with the 
      environment and fully grasp the essence of embodied intelligence? 
      Can we achieve digital twins of our soft robots? What is the 
      required relation between accurate modelling and accurate 
      fabrication? How to overcome the reality gap? Those and other questions 
      will be discussed at the workshop. We argue that a wider adoption 
      of computational modeling in soft robotics provides opportunities 
      for progressing towards a model- informed discipline, ultimately 
      responding to societal needs. The challenges involved stand as 
      research opportunities in multiple fields. 
      Transition from prototype-based to model-informed design in soft 
      robotics is within grasp, in an interdisciplinary dialogue that 
      we wish to promote starting with this workshop.
